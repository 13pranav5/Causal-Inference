# Effect of increase in federal minimum wage on unemployment rate in the United states

## Motivation

The Federal government has recently proposed a minimum wage policy change. The last time when Fed increased its minimum wage rate was 2009 and no changes have been observed in minimum wage rate since then. However, recently Democrats introduced bill to hike federal minimum wage gradually to $15 per hour, more than the double than that of the current minimum wage rate of $7.25 (Source 4).

Considering the scale at which hike has been proposed, we wanted to study what is the causal impact of
raising the Federal minimum wage rate on unemployment. Does hike in the Federal minimum wage rate lead to
more unemployment, as has been suggested by many? Hence, we decided to choose our focus of study on this topic. We believe a coherent and thoughtful study of this topic could help the Fed decide better whether to pursue hike in the Federal minimum wage or not.
